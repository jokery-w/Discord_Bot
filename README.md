# Discord_Bot
This bot connects directly to Discord’s WebSocket Gateway using Python’s asyncio, json, aiohttp, and websockets libraries. It establishes a persistent connection, maintains heartbeat synchronization, and identifies itself to receive real-time events like server joins, messages, and status updates.
